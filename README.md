This code is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on content similarity. It performs the following steps:

Data Loading and Merging:

Loads two CSV files: one containing movie details (Movies.csv) and the other containing credits (Credits.csv).
Merges these two datasets on the 'title' column.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Selects relevant columns: 'movie_id', 'title', 'overview', 'genres', 'keywords', 'cast', and 'crew'. <br>
Removes rows with missing values. <br>
Defines functions to extract and transform the 'genres', 'keywords', 'cast', and 'crew' columns into lists of names. <br>
Converts these lists into lower-case strings and removes spaces. <br>
Combines the 'overview', 'genres', 'keywords', 'cast', and 'crew' columns into a single 'tags' column. <be>

Text Vectorization: <br>
 <br>
Uses CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the 'tags' column into a matrix of token counts. <br>
Stems the words in the 'tags' column to their root forms. <be>
 <br>
Similarity Calculation: <br>
 <br>
Calculates the cosine similarity between the movie 'tags' vectors to create a similarity matrix. <be>
 <br>
Recommendation Function: <br>

Defines a recommend function that takes a movie title as input and finds the top 5 most similar movies based on the cosine similarity scores. <br>
 <br>
Saving Data: <br>
 <br>
Saves the preprocessed movie data and the similarity matrix using pickle for later use.
<br>
Conclusion <br>
 <br>
The movie recommendation system effectively identifies and suggests movies that are similar to a given movie based on the content described in their overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. By using natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and cosine similarity, the system provides meaningful recommendations that can enhance user experience on movie recommendation platforms. The modular and well-organized code makes it easy to maintain and extend, allowing for the potential inclusion of more features or refinement of existing ones.

Here's a sample run of the recommendation function, which prints out similar movie titles for the input movie "Noah":

python <br>
Copy code
recommend("Noah") <br>
The output would be the titles of the top 5 most similar movies to "Noah" based on their content features. The use of cosine similarity ensures that the recommendations are based on the textual similarity of the combined 'tags' column.  <br>

##### output: 

    Iron Man 3
    Iron Man 2
    Avengers: Age of Ultron
    The Avengers
    Captain America: Civil War
